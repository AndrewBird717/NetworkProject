Prompts used:
    + I need to make a simple chat app that utilizes a client server   model. I need the app to run on an initial framework, and make it in a way that I can easily add different features modularly. This is for a class assignment, and I need to create an initial barebones framework for the application then upgrade it from there. Make me this app, make it a terminal based application where a client can connect to an active server using a simple command, i.e. ChatClient.py [IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER]. Additionally I need the server to support multiple clients.
    + so what exactly does chatcore do?
    + what do I put in init.py?
    + I need to submit the prompts used in the networking assignment… can you make the class diagram/improvement plan stuff for the networking project as described?

Process:
    + We started with the framework of the base modular files from chatGPT.
        + This includes "__init.py", "handler.py", "protocol.py", "ChatClient.py", and  "ChatServer.py".
    + We created a Github Repository so work on the project together allowing for collaboration.
